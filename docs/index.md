## Motivation
While making a game, I simply wanted some UI particles. The best module I found was [UIParticle](https://github.com/nuttolum/UIParticle/tree/main), but it was lacking features that I needed to make nice-looking and advanced particles.

I ended up taking a few hours to make a better module, and this EmitYourParticles is the result. It's surprisingly capable with what it can do!

I have optimizations and improvements in mind and depending on the reaction this gets, I might add them (give a ‚ù§ to the [DevForum post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/emityourparticle-a-faster-and-better-2d-particle-emitter-v100/2842247)).

## Feature list

I aimed make the behaviour made by EmitYourParticle emitters replicate the normal particle emitters. Here are some settings:

 - Transparency/color
 - Acceleration
 - Drag
 - Spread
 - Lifetime
 - Rotation
 - Emit Shape (Emit from an area or point)
 - and many more. Check out the [usage](usage.md) tab to see a full list!
